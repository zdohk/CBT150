+   To transmit data (i.e., a dataset and/or a message), a destination must be
+   supplied. This may be either a NICKNAME or a NODE & USERID.  The use of
+   NICKNAMES is strongly recommended as it simplifies the destination
+   specification.  Entering the value NAMES in the "NICKNAME ===>" field
+   provides a convenient method of viewing or editing your personal
+   nicknames dataset.  A model nicknames dataset containing customization
+   instructions will be automatically created for first-time users of the
+   NICKNAME function.
+
+   Specifying multiple nicknames is permissable in this field. For example:
+   NICKNAME ===> JONES SMITH PAYROLL  would transmit to user JONES, user
+   SMITH and all users listed in group nickname PAYROLL.
+
+   Should you decide to transmit using the NODE & USERID method:
+   - valid node names are: ABL, SALTLAKE, & WILM .
+   - a valid userid is any TSO Userid at that node.
