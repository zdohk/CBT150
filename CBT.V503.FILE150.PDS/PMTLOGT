%
+ The LOG PROCESSING field provides the ability to view (via option B) or EDIT
+ (via option E) your LOG dataset. This dataset contains a record of all
+ TRANSMIT and RECEIVE activity. Log entries are chronologically arranged.  A
+ transmission of data creates a time-stamped record in the LOG indicating
+ "what" was sent to "who".  Receipt of the data creates an "acknowledgement"
+ entry, thereby providing a convenient time-stamped cross-reference to the
+ original transmission.
+
+
+ Data in this file may be freely edited (lines deleted, changed, etc.) anytime.
+ It is suggested that periodic "housecleaning" be performed so as to retain
+ only needed information.
