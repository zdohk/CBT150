%TUTORIAL -------------- RECEIVE : Restore Parameters ---------------- TUTORIAL
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
% Restore parameters+are:
+
%  DATASET+ You may specify the name of a dataset to contain the file being
+   received. This dataset will be created if it doesn't exist.  If you know
+   that a dataset that was TRANSMITted to you matches a dataset name already
+   allocated to your userid, a new dataset name may be selected during RECEIVE
+   processing so as to prevent overlaying an existing dataset. When the RECEIVE
+   command prompts you with  "Enter restore parameters or 'DELETE' or 'END'",
+   enter:  DATASET(new.dataset.name).  By explicity specifying the DATASET
+   keyword,  the contents of the dataset created will be identical to the
+   transmitted dataset with the exception of it's new dataset name.
+
+   A valid response to RECEIVE%restore parameters+is to press ENTER.  In this
+   case, the dataset received will be the name of the transmitted data set.  If
+   you already have a dataset of this name and it is a sequential-type dataset,
+   then RECEIVE will prompt you for your permission to overwrite it. If this
+   dataset is a partitioned-type dataset, identically named members will be
+   automatically replaced upon your permission.
