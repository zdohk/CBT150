+ Use the%OPTIONAL OPERANDS+field to request additional TRANSMIT services:
+
% *+You may, in addition to transmitting data, append a message to      your
+  transmission by specifying MSG in the OPTIONAL OPERANDS field.  Your message
+  may be a one-liner or several pages.  When received by the user, the message
+  text will appear on the terminal and will also be stored in the receiving
+  user's LOG file for future reference.
+
% *+You may transmit a message without transmitting any data by leaving  both
+  the DATASET NAME field and the OPTIONAL OPERANDS field blank.  When sending a
+  message only, a blank screen will appear labelled 'DATA FOR destination'.
+  Type the message text anywhere on this screen then press PF3 to initiate the
+  message transmittal.
+
% *+You may transmit selected members of a library-type DATASET by specifying
+  MEMBERS(memname1 memname2 etc.).  Omitting the MEMBERS operand results in the
   transmittal of all members of a library-type dataset.
+
% *+There are many additional optional operands that can be specified.  To view
+   these, enter TSO HELP TRANSMIT in the "COMMAND ===>" field above.
